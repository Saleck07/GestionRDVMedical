### 🧩 Frontend Pages

The React frontend provides a dynamic user interface with distinct pages for various functionalities:

- **Home Page (`/`)**:
  - **Description**: The landing page of the application, welcoming users and highlighting key features and services of the clinic.
  - **Interaction**: Provides navigation links to other parts of the application, particularly for booking appointments.
  - **Components**: Displays hero section, services, and advantages of the clinic.
- **Login Page (`/login`)**:
  - **Description**: Allows registered users (patients, doctors, or admins) to log into their respective accounts.
  - **Interaction**: Sends `POST` requests to `/api/auth/login` with user credentials. Upon successful login, receives a JWT token, user role, and user ID from the backend, which are then stored in local storage and used for subsequent authenticated requests. Redirects users based on their role (`/Admin`, `/DashboardMedecin`, `/`).
- **Register Page (`/register`)**:
  - **Description**: Enables new users to create an account as a patient or a doctor. Admin registration would typically be managed internally or by existing admins.
  - **Interaction**: Sends `POST` requests to `/api/auth/register` with user details (name, email, password, role, etc.). Redirects to the login page upon successful registration.
- **Doctors Page (`/medecins`)**:
  - **Description**: Displays a comprehensive list of all doctors available in the system.
  - **Interaction**: Fetches doctor data from `/api/medecins` via `GET` request. Users can click on a doctor to view their detailed profile.
- **Doctor Details Page (`/medecins/:id`)**:
  - **Description**: Shows detailed information about a specific doctor and allows patients to book appointments.
  - **Interaction**: Fetches doctor details from `/api/medecins/{id}` and their availability from `/api/disponibilites/medecin/{id}`. Patients can select an available slot and send a `POST` request to `/api/rendezvous/add` to book an appointment. It also fetches the patient's existing appointments from `/api/rendezvous/patient/{patientId}` to check for overlaps.
- **Appointments Page (`/Rendez-vous`) (Patient View)**:
  - **Description**: Allows logged-in patients to view and manage their personal appointments.
  - **Interaction**: Fetches patient-specific appointments from `/api/rendezvous` (filtered by `userId`). Patients can update an appointment's motif by sending a `PUT` request to `/api/rendezvous/update/{id}` or delete an appointment with a `DELETE` request to `/api/rendezvous/{id}`.
- **Admin Dashboard (`/Admin`)**:
  - **Description**: The main entry point for administrators, providing links to manage different entities within the system.
  - **Interaction**: Purely navigational within the frontend, leading to other admin management pages. Enforces `ROLE_ADMIN` authentication.
- **Admin Patient Management (`/AdminPatient`)**:
  - **Description**: Provides an interface for administrators to manage patient records (view, add, edit, delete).
  - **Interaction**: Interacts with `/api/patients` for `GET` (all), `POST` (add), `PUT` (update), and `DELETE` (delete) operations.
- **Admin Doctor Management (`/AdminMedecin`)**:
  - **Description**: Provides an interface for administrators to manage doctor records (view, add, edit, delete).
  - **Interaction**: Interacts with `/api/medecins` for `GET` (all), `POST` (add), `PUT` (update), and `DELETE` (delete) operations.
- **Admin Appointment Management (`/AdminRendezVous`)**:
  - **Description**: Allows administrators to manage all appointments in the system (view, add, edit, delete).
  - **Interaction**: Interacts with `/api/rendezvous` for `GET` (all), `POST` (add), `PUT` (update), and `DELETE` (delete) operations. Also fetches lists of patients and doctors from `/api/patients` and `/api/medecins` for selection during appointment creation/editing.
- **Doctor Dashboard (`/DashboardMedecin`)**:
  - **Description**: The primary dashboard for doctors, summarizing their appointments, patients, and allowing management of availabilities.
  - **Interaction**: Fetches doctor details from `/api/medecins/{medecinId}`, appointments from `/api/rendezvous/medecin/{medecinId}`, patients from `/api/medecin/{medecinId}/patients`, and availabilities from `/api/disponibilites/medecin/{medecinId}`. Allows creating new availabilities (`POST /api/disponibilites/add`), updating appointment statuses (e.g., `PUT /api/rendezvous/update/{id}`), and deleting availabilities (`DELETE /api/disponibilites/{id}`).

### 🚀 Installation & Usage

Follow these steps to set up and run the Clinique Rendez-Vous application locally.

#### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 or higher**
- **Node.js (LTS version recommended)**
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **Yarn**
- **MySQL Database** (or other relational database supported by JPA)

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

#### 2. Backend Setup (Springboot)

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**

    ```bash
    cd Springboot
    ```

2.  **Configure Database:**

    - Open `src/main/resources/application.properties`.
    - Ensure your MySQL database connection details are correctly configured:
      ```properties
      spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/springbootdb
      spring.datasource.username=root
      spring.datasource.password=
      ```
      - **Note**: Replace `springbootdb` with your database name, `root` with your MySQL username, and provide your `password` if you have one configured.
      - The application uses `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update`, which will automatically create/update tables on startup if they don't exist.

3.  **Build the Backend:**

    - Use Maven to build the project.

    ```bash
    ./mvnw clean install
    # On Windows, use: mvnw.cmd clean install
    ```

4.  **Run the Backend Application:**
    ```bash
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    # On Windows, use: mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
    ```
    The backend will start on `http://localhost:8082`.
    You can verify the API documentation (Swagger UI) at `http://localhost:8082/swagger-ui.html`.

#### 3. Frontend Setup (React)

1.  **Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:**

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    - Using npm:
      ```bash
      npm install
      ```
    - Or using Yarn:
      ```bash
      yarn install
      ```

3.  **Run the Frontend Application:**
    - Using npm:
      ```bash
      npm start
      ```
    - Or using Yarn:
      `bash
    yarn start
    `
      The frontend application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 🔐 Environment Configuration

#### Frontend (`frontend/.env.local`)

For local development, the frontend is configured to connect to `http://localhost:8082` by default (see `frontend/src/login.js`). If your backend is hosted elsewhere, you would typically use an `.env.local` file (ignored by Git) to specify the API base URL.

Example `frontend/.env.local`:

```
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8082
```

(Although not explicitly used in the provided `login.js` `axios.defaults.baseURL`, it's a common pattern for production deployments.)

#### Backend (`Springboot/src/main/resources/application.properties`)

The backend configuration is managed directly within `application.properties`.

```properties
spring.application.name=backend
server.port=8082
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/springbootdb
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
logging.level.org.springframework=DEBUG
logging.level.org.hibernate.SQL=DEBUG
```

- `server.port`: The port on which the Spring Boot application runs.
- `spring.datasource.*`: Database connection details (URL, username, password, driver).
- `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto`: Hibernate DDL generation strategy. `update` will update the schema based on entity changes. For production, consider `validate` or `none` and manage schema with migrations.

---

### 📦 Optional Sections

#### Authentication Method

The application implements **JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication** using Spring Security on the backend.

- When a user logs in via `/api/auth/login`, the backend authenticates credentials and, upon success, generates a JWT containing the user's email, role, and ID. This token is sent back to the frontend.
- On the frontend, this JWT is stored in `localStorage` (`token`, `userRole`, `userId`).
- For all subsequent authenticated requests from the frontend, the JWT is included in the `Authorization` header as a `Bearer` token (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>`).
- The `JwtFilter` on the backend intercepts these requests, validates the token, extracts user details, and sets the `SecurityContextHolder`, allowing Spring Security to enforce role-based access control (e.g., `ROLE_ADMIN`, `ROLE_MEDECIN`, `ROLE_PATIENT`).
- Protected routes on the frontend (`ProtectedRoute.js`) ensure that only users with the correct roles can access specific pages.

#### Testing Strategy

- **Frontend**: The React application includes default testing setup with `react-scripts`. You can run frontend tests using:
  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm test
  # or yarn test
  ```
  This launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
- **Backend**: The Spring Boot application includes `spring-boot-starter-test`, which provides JUnit and Mockito for unit and integration testing. A basic test `BackendApplicationTests.java` is present. You can run backend tests using Maven:
  ```bash
  cd Springboot
  ./mvnw test
  # On Windows: mvnw.cmd test
  ```

#### API Documentation

The Spring Boot backend is configured with **SpringDoc OpenAPI UI** (based on Swagger UI). Once the backend is running, you can access the interactive API documentation at:
`http://localhost:8082/swagger-ui.html`
This interface allows you to explore all available endpoints, their expected inputs, and possible responses directly in your browser.

#### Deployment Guide (High-Level)

- **Frontend**: To deploy the React application, build it for production:
  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm run build
  # or yarn build
  ```
  This creates a `build` folder with optimized static assets, which can then be served by any static file server (e.g., Nginx, Apache, or a CDN).
- **Backend**: To deploy the Spring Boot application, the `mvnw clean install` command generates a `.jar` file in the `Springboot/target/` directory (e.g., `backend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`). This executable JAR can be run on any server with a compatible Java Runtime Environment (JRE):
  ```bash
  java -jar backend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
  ```
  For production environments, consider using Docker, cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP), or traditional server deployments with process managers (e.g., Systemd, pm2).
